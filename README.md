# DecisionTreeRegression
After learning multiple linear regression, let's dive into decision tree regression. Unlike traditional linear regression, which assumes a straight-line relationship between input features and the target variable, Decision Tree Regression is a non-linear regression method that can handle complex datasets with intricate patterns. It uses a tree-like model to make predictions, making it both flexible and easy to interpret. 
OVERSIGHT
Decision Tree Regression predicts continuous values. It does this by splitting the data into smaller subsets based on decision rules derived from the input features. Each split is made to minimize the error in predicting the target variable. At leaf node of the tree the model predicts a continuous value which is typically the average of the target values in that node.
House Price Prediction using Decision Tree Regression

Synopsis
This project aims to predict house prices using a Decision Tree Regression model. The dataset contains various features related to properties, and the goal is to develop a model that accurately estimates house prices. The project also includes error analysis and visual error analysis to assess the model's performance.

Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

Square Footage: Total area of the house in square feet.

Number of Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.

Number of Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house.

Lot Size: Total area of the land on which the house is built.

Price: The target variable representing the house price (in USD).

Data Format

The dataset is stored in a CSV file.
Project Structure

Data Preprocessing: Loading and cleaning the data.

Model Building: Implementing decision tree regression to predict house prices.

Model Evaluation: Calculating performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

Error Analysis: Visualizing residuals, actual vs. predicted prices.

Limitations

Overfitting can occur if the decision tree is too deep.

Performance may vary depending on the dataset quality and feature selection.

Future Improvements

Implementing ensemble methods like Random Forest to improve accuracy.

Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal tree depth and criteria.
